## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

Since the site uses Netlify's image CDN for on-the-fly image resizing, 
once you've connected with Netlify (instructions TBA), you should run:

```sh
npm run dev:netlify
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
